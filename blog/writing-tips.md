# Not sure how to start that assignment? Here are 5 top tips
1. **Have a system** - break down the process of writing an assignment into seven smaller, more manageable steps.
2. **Know what you're doing** - make sure that you understand the assignment brief and the specific requirements of your assignment type. A scientific report looks very different from a reflective piece!
3. **Plan ahead** - map out your whole assignment before you sit down to write. Outline the main points you want to make and decide how you will support them.
4. **Just start writing** - focus on putting your ideas on the page without worrying too much about the style at first, then revise and edit as necessary. Having a first draft to improve upon is much less daunting than facing the blank page.
5. **Meet your deadline** - set internal deadlines for each step of the process. Build some buffers into your plan and leave time at the end for editing and proofreading.


## How can I become a more efficient writer?
Write fast, edit slow. Don’t spend hours trying to produce the perfect paragraph on your first try – this can lead to procrastination and writer’s block.

Instead, get used to the idea of drafting and redrafting: write your first draft quickly and give yourself plenty of time for revisions and edits.
