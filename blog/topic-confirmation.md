Hi Alan,

Could you please give me feedback on the assessment topic that I've chosen?

Title: AI-based Logistics and Supply Chain Management 
Description: Businesses have a need to understand how their customers think and behave to deliver the best-personalised customer experience. Therefore, by analysing consumer data using AI we can better predict demand and scale services in real-time to benefit consumers, society and the economy while still preserving privacy.

Hi Sakthignana

That's a good start, but it is too broad and you need to narrow it down like the following ..
- what kind of AI, deep learning or rule based indiction or other machine learning ?
- what about data that is collected to feed the AI algos, is there enough of it, does it have imbalances or biases ?
- is there an economic benefit or business model that would pay back the investment in AI ?
- are there particular kinds of SCM that AI is more/less suited to ?

Come back to me with some further thoughts, but you are on the right track

- Alan

Hi Alan,

Thanks for your feedback!

Here are my further thoughts: I would like to focus on the event management side of logistics and SCM. 
- Eventgoers can be given a smart band that they can top up and use throughout the festival period in and around the festival region. This data can then be collected and cleaned (in compliance with GDPR) for analysis. The collected dataset can also be combined with other related datasets to provide a holistic view of the supply chain requirements.
- AI - usage of a recommender system that can recommend ideal places to host an event; chat-bot service for customers who might need information before, during or after the event.
- The economic benefit is that we can predict the supply chain requirements for future events with a higher level of accuracy (compared to conventional methods), once we know the number of tickets sold. Hence, this service can be made available for a fee to event organisers and the host of the event. The value proposition is to provide a great and engaging experience for the customer.

Please let me know what you think üòÅ

Regards, 
Sakthi
